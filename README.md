# Geometric-Shape-Detection
A deep learning-based application for detecting geometric shapes (circle, square, triangle, etc.) in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project includes synthetic dataset generation, bounding box labeling, model training, real-time detection, and a Flask-based web interface for image uploads.
